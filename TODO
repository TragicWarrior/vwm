This is an evergreen TODO list in no particular order:

* Support multiple desktops.
* Load wallpaper created by Aewan.
* Create a true screen saver subsystem.
* Create a module for loading files with mplayer.
* Update panel when libviper supports clock and spinner klasses.
* Add an About and Credits panel.
* Support screen freezing (for GPM copy and paste).
* Create a menu editor module which can take care of adding and removing
  programs from the main menu.
* Don't hard-code menu categories.
