REQUIREMENTS

glib 2.8+
libutil
libpseudo
libvterm
libviper 1.2+
vwm
directory /usr/lib/vwm/modules

INSTALLATION

To install, simply run the following make commands as root:

make
make install

If you compiled libviper with wide character support then you will need to
run the following make commands as root instead of those mentioned above.

make wide
make install

If everything builds correctly, you should have a file in the
/usr/lib/vwm/modules directory called vwmterm3.so.  Next time you restart
VWM, you will automatically have a new item called "Terminal Shell" on the
Main Menu.

NOTES

If you have previous versions of vwmterm or ptyterm installed, it is highly
recommended that you delete these from your vwm modules directory to avoid
possible symbol conflicts.

Enjoy!
