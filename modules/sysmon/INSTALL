REQUIREMENTS

glib 2.8+
libgtop2
libviper
vwm
directory /usr/lib/vwm/modules

INSTALLATION

To install, simply run the following make commands as root:

make
make install

If you compiled libviper with wide character support then you will need to
run the following make commands as root instead of those mentioned above.

make wide
make install

If everything builds correctly, you should have a file in the
/usr/lib/vwm/modules directory called sysmon.so.  Next time you restart
VWM, you will automatically have a new item called "System Monitor" on the
Main Menu.

Enjoy!
