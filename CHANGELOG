   improved portability.

*  removed useles debug: rule from Makefile.

Version 1.3.3 (unreleased)

*  removed smir and rmir definitions from terminfo
   file.  they were confusing to bash and unnecessary.

*  removed the dependency on the non-portable
   ncurses win_st flag _WRAPPED.

*  fixed the issue with writting to bottom right corner
   which caused top to misbehave.  the fix causes
   a small problem with 'ps aux' but that should be
   relatively simple to fix.

Version 1.3.2

*  minor bugfix to Makefile which prevented first-time
   compilation of ptyterm from working.

Version 1.3.1

*  minor bugfix to ptyterm which keeps unhandled escape
   codes from being written to the display.  (fixes
   corruption caused by gcc errors and the odd glyphs
   seen in man pages).

Version 1.3.0

   been replaced by an "information ticker" on the main

   marquee panel (not 100% implemented)

   terminfo entry for vwmterm so that bash
   command/history editing will work correctly.

*  fixed an environment issue with ptyterm which caused
   some environment variables to be trampled (tested
   the change with Motor IDE which used to abort at
   startup).

*  added gcc -O2 optimizations to Makefile and moved
   to C99 standard (mostly for long long int).

Version 1.2.3

*  screensaver bug fix.  the built-in screensaver was
   not being resized with the terminal was resized.

Version 1.2.2

*  minor changes to accommodate API changes in libviper.

*  update built-in modules for default NORESIZE state
   set by libviper at window creation time.

*  windows which cannot be resized will not display the
   "resize grip" in the window frame.

Version 1.2.1

*  updated a few lines to accomodate msgbox changes in
   libviper.

Version 1.2.0

*  new user profile API.

*  preliminary support for private module/plugin loading
   from ~/.vwm/modules directory.

*  preliminary support for user specific configuration
   with the ~/.vwm/vwmrc file.

*  new screensaver subsystem and API.

*  set default screensaver timeout with vwmrc file

*  set default menu hotkey with vwmrc file

*  new "keycodes" tool provides VWM compatible keystroke

   codes for definining a custom menu hotkey.
*  updated Makefile to build ptyterm automatically.

*  minor code cleanups.

Version 1.1.6

*  correcty a bug introduced in version 1.1.5 which
   caused tab-stops to be unhandled by the ptyterm
   parser.

*  fixed a TODO item to promote *BSD porting.

*  fixed the problem with ptyterm and the paging utility
   "less" (may fix others also).

*  better prevention and handling of broken escape
   sequences in ptyterm.

Version 1.1.5

*  added termcap "rs1" (terminal reset) entry to
   vwmterm tic file and corresponding escape code
   parser to ptyterm.

*  ptyterm adapts to tty settings +ONLCR and -ONLCR.  many
   programs change these modes without asking :) which
   was causing many incompatibilites.

*  added termcap "cuf" (cursor forward) entry to
   vwmterm tic file and corresponding escape code
   parser to ptyterm.  this fixed rkhunter (and
   probably others) that were sending cuf even though
   it is was undefined.

Version 1.1.4

*  fixed a significant memory leak in the VWM main menu.

*  added internal function vwm_menu_marshal() which makes
   the main menu behave in a more "refined" manner.

*  changed the sysmon mechanism for fetching load average to
   getloadavg() instead of using libgtop2 for simplification.

*  fixed a crash bug in screensaver configuration ui.

*  colorized form in screensaver ui.

*  mandatory change for API libviper window_fill() routine.

*  fixed the 4k memory leak in ptyterm.

*  fixed some theoretical leaks.

*  added some additional saftey checks.

*  general code cleanup.

Version 1.1.3

*  fixed a compile bug

*  added this CHANGELOG file

Version 1.1.2

*  fixed a bug which caused keystrokes that had already been handled by
   a hotkey handler to be propogated to the toplevel window.

Version 1.1.1

*  fixed a small, but critical bug which caused screensaver wake-up to be
   handled incorrectly.

Version 1.1

*  added support for screensavers.  screensavers are normal windows which
   belong to the category VWM_SCREENSAVER.

*  added a broadcast event "vwm-clock-tick" which fires every 1/10 second
   (#define VWM_CLOCK_TICK).  this replaced the individual clocks which
   drove the default plugin 'sysmon' and the screensaver subsystem.

*  added a default screensaver called 'syssaver'.

*  changed the CPU enumeration mechanism for default plugin 'sysmon'.

*  moved the hotkey support out of libviper and into vwm where it made
   more sense.

Version 1.0

*  initial release.
