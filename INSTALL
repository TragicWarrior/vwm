REQUIRMENTS

glib 2.8+
libpseudo (available from SourceForge)
libviper 1.4.5+ (available from SouceForge)
libgpm (no longer required as of build 1.1 but you will need to remove
        the build definition -D_VIPER_MOUSE_GPM from the Makefile)
ncurses 5.4+


OPTIONAL REQUIRMENTS

VWM is distributed with 2 basic applications:  ptyterm and sysmon.  ptyterm
is a terminal emulator and sysmon monitors cpu and memory usage like top
or gnome-system-monitor.

--vwmterm---
In order to build ptyterm, your system will need to support the terminfo
facilites (most do) and have the following pieces of software installed:

libutil (should be installed on most libc systems)
libvterm

--sysmon--
In order to build sysmon, your system will need the additional libraries:

libgtop2


INSTALLATION

By default, the Makefile tries to create a /usr/lib/vwm/modules directory.
This is where all of the applications (plugins) for VWM will be installed.  At
the present time, this location is hard-coded.  In the future, VWM should
allow the user to specify otherwise.  You will need to creat this directory
manually.

For a simple installation run the following make commands as root:

make
make install

If you built libviper with support for wide characters, you will need to
compile the wide version of VWM.  Instead of using the make commands listed
above you will need to do:

make wide
make install

Currently, the Makefile does not build ptyterm or sysmon.  You will need to
do that manually.  See the INSTALL file for each of those plugins.

Enjoy!
