BUILT IN BACKTRACE

The default Makefile rule for vwm will build a verions with debugging
symbols and a backtrace mechanism based on the GNU libc backtrace() 
facility.  The result is a larger binary which should help me track down
an obscure race condition bug which I have only seen once.  Should you
encounter this bug, please copy and paste the backtrace into and email
and send it to bryan.christ@gmail.com

If you would like to disable this feature resulting in a leaner binary,
simiply follow these steps:

1.  Open the Makefile with your favorite text editor.
2.  Remove "-ggdb" from CFLAGS
3.  Remove "-D_DEBUG" from DEFS
4.  Save the file, close your editor, and run "make".
5.  Run "strip vmw".
6.  Run "make install".
7.  You're done!
