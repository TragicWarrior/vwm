* Stray charagers in Gnome Terminal and Terminal

When VWM is running in Gnome Terminal or Terminal, you may experience some
screen corruption.  This sometimes occurs when the terminal emulator places
a character in the right-most column.  It appears to be a bug in libvte which
is part of the GTK+ library.  The same corruption does not happen when VWM
is running on xterm, rxvt, or a standard Linux tty.  A bug report has
been filed with the maintainer of libvte but I am not aware of any fix.
It is reported that this bug can be reproduced without using VWM but some
other tool like Midnight Commander.

* Control characters appear on the screen

If VWM crashes on exit, somehow the terminal states are not completely
restored to their previous condition.  This is _possibly_ fixed with VWM
version 2.1.1 or higher.
